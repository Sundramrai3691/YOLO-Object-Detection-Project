# YOLO-Object-Detection-Project
This repository contains a YOLO-based object detection project that demonstrates real-time detection and classification of objects using the YOLOv5 model. The project leverages OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization. The model is trained on a custom dataset, and the repository includes all the necessary code to preprocess images, train the YOLO model, and run object detection on live video streams or image files.
# Features
Preprocessing of images using OpenCV (resizing, normalization, etc.)
Custom training of the YOLOv5 model on a dataset
Real-time object detection from video input or images
Bounding box visualization with class labels and confidence scores
Evaluation of model accuracy and performance metrics
# Technologies Used
Python
YOLOv8 (PyTorch-based)
OpenCV
Jupyter Notebooks / Python scripts
